# Let's strat! Set workdir, source code and load packages!
```{r prep-to-start}
# be in the right place
setwd("/local/workdir/ys636/BIOMI6300-Project2")

# source functions.R
source("/local/workdir/ys636/BIOMI6300-Project2/code/functions.R")

# load packages with pacman
pacman::p_load(dada2, tidyverse, phyloseq, patchwork, Biostrings, install = FALSE)

# check dada2 version
packageVersion("dada2")
```



# Set path
```{r set-path}

# set paths for meat and dairy folders of gzipped files
path <- ("/local/workdir/ys636/BIOMI6300-Project2/data")

# check path
list.files(path)

```

# Create variables for forward and reverse reads
```{r F-and-R-variables}
#R1 is forward, R2 is reverse
# F and R variables
F_reads <- sort(list.files(path, pattern = "_1.fastq",
                                 full.names = TRUE))

R_reads <- sort(list.files(path, pattern = "_2.fastq",
                                 full.names = TRUE))

```

# Quality plot of raw reads
```{r QualPlot-untrimmed}
# show the quality of each base on the reads of all the 8 samples in both groups

## Forward
F_Qual_plot <- plotQualityProfile(F_reads[1:4])
F_Qual_plot                     ### The first 260 bases had quality scores over 30
## Reverse
R_Qual_plot <- plotQualityProfile(R_reads[1:4])
R_Qual_plot                      ### The first 200ish bases had quality scores over 30

```


# Modify file names for the forward and reverse filtered reads
```{r variables-trimmed-reads}

# Create characters for trimmed reads 
sample <- scan(file = "/local/workdir/ys636/BIOMI6300-Project2/data/name.txt", what = "character")
sample

# create variables to hold file names
filtered_F_reads <- file.path(path, "filtered", paste0(sample, "_1_filtered.fastq"))
filtered_R_reads <- file.path(path, "filtered", paste0(sample, "_2_filtered.fastq"))
