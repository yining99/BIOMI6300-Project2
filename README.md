## About this project:

### Project name

Study of gut microbiota in formula-fed infants consuming meat vs. dairy-based complementary foods\
([doi: 10.3389/fnut.2022.1063518](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.1063518/full))

### Sample source

**Stool samples** collected from infants who are:

-   full-term, formula-fed
-   recruited from the metro Denver area (Colorado, US)
-   age 5-12 months old

### Hypotheses to be tested

1.  The gut microbiota of formula-fed infants having meat as complementary food is different than that of those having dairy-based complementary food.
    -   species richness between two groups
    -   16s rRNA gene abundance
    -   beta diversity

## What are included in this repo:

ðŸ“‚`data` has all the 16s rRNA sequencing data in fastq.gz format.
